# Space Invaders

This project is an implementation of the classic Space Invaders arcade game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows players to control a shooter at the bottom of the screen, shooting lasers to eliminate descending alien invaders. Here's a breakdown of the project:

Key Features:

Grid Setup: The game grid is created dynamically, and the player's shooter is initialized at the center of the grid.

Alien Invaders: A group of alien invaders is drawn on the grid, with predefined starting positions. The player's goal is to eliminate these invaders.

Shooter Control: Players can move the shooter left and right using the arrow keys, and it's visually represented on the grid.

Invader Movement: The alien invaders move horizontally across the grid. When they reach the edges, they drop down and change direction.

Shooting Mechanism: Players can shoot lasers using the "Arrow Up" key. The lasers move upward and can hit the alien invaders.

Collision Handling: When a laser hits an invader, an explosion animation occurs, and the invader is removed from the grid. The player's score is updated accordingly.

Game Over and Win Conditions: The game ends when the player's shooter is hit by an invader or when all invaders are eliminated, resulting in victory.

Inspiration: The project was inspired by Code with Ania Kub√≥w's YouTube tutorial.

This project provides a fun and interactive implementation of the Space Invaders game, serving as a great learning resource for web development enthusiasts. Have fun playing and learning from this classic arcade game implementation!
